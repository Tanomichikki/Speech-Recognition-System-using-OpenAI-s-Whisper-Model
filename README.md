# Speech-Recognition-System-using-OpenAI-s-Whisper-Model
Welcome to the Speech Recognition System built using OpenAI's Whisper model. This project leverages cutting-edge machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to provide a robust speech-to-text solution. The user interface is powered by Gradio, making it simple and intuitive to use.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
Whisper (OpenAI): A state-of-the-art model for automatic speech recognition (ASR).
Python: The primary programming language for the backend logic.
Gradio: An easy-to-use interface for interacting with machine learning models.
Machine Learning Libraries: Numpy, Pandas (if needed), etc.

# üí° Features:
Real-time Speech Recognition: Convert speech to text accurately and quickly.
Multiple Language Support: Recognize and transcribe speech in multiple languages.
Gradio Interface: A web-based interface to interact with the model easily.

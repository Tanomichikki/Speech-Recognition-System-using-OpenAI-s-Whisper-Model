# Speech-Recognition-System-using-OpenAI-s-Whisper-Model
Welcome to the ** Speech Recognition System ** built using ** OpenAI's Whisper model **. This project offers an advanced speech-to-text solution, capable of transcribing audio in multiple foreign languages and converting it to various Indian regional languages such as ** Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Gujarati, ** and more.

Leveraging the power of Whisper, a state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model, this system offers superior accuracy and support for a wide variety of languages. The system is designed to work seamlessly with a user-friendly interface powered by ** Gradio **.

# üí° How It Works:
The system uses ** OpenAI's Whisper model ** to perform speech recognition, which is capable of transcribing audio from foreign languages into text. The unique aspect of this system is that, in addition to transcribing directly into English or the original spoken language, it can also ** translate ** the transcribed text into multiple ** Indian regional languages **. This is particularly useful for creating translations and transcriptions that are relevant to the Indian audience.

Whisper‚Äôs training data includes a wide range of audio clips from various languages, ensuring that it works with a variety of speech patterns, accents, and dialects. The model excels in recognizing speech from both high-quality and noisy audio sources, making it a versatile tool for different use cases.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
* Whisper (OpenAI): A state-of-the-art model for automatic speech recognition (ASR).
* Python: The primary programming language for the backend logic.
* Gradio: An easy-to-use interface for interacting with machine learning models.
* Machine Learning Libraries: Tensorflow, an ASR model using Whisper, ASR neural network and AI technologies.

# üí° Features:
* Real-time Speech Recognition: Convert speech to text accurately and quickly.
* Multiple Language Support: Recognize and transcribe speech in multiple languages.
* Gradio Interface: A web-based interface to interact with the model easily.
